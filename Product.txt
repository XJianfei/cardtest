# FlashMind AI - Product Design & Functional Specification

## 1. Product Overview
FlashMind AI is an intelligent study tool designed to reduce the friction of creating educational materials. By leveraging the Gemini API, it transforms broad topics into structured, high-quality flashcard decks in seconds, while also providing robust manual editing and progress tracking features.

## 2. Core Design Principles
- **Minimalism & Focus**: A clean, distraction-free interface (Slate/Indigo palette) prioritizing the study experience.
- **Immediate Value**: "Zero to study" in under 10 seconds via AI generation.
- **Positive Reinforcement**: Use of visual feedback (confetti, progress bars) to motivate learners.
- **Mobile First**: Fully responsive layouts ensuring students can study on the go.

## 3. Functional Modules

### 3.1 AI Generation Engine (`services/geminiService.ts`)
- **Model**: Utilizes `gemini-3-flash-preview` for its speed and high reasoning capability for educational content.
- **Logic**: 
    - Takes a user-defined topic and requested card count.
    - Employs a structured JSON response schema (`responseMimeType: "application/json"`) to ensure data integrity.
    - Generates 'front' (concept/question) and 'back' (concise explanation/answer).
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for API failures with user-facing alerts.

### 3.2 Study Session Logic (`components/StudyView.tsx`)
- **Session State**: Maintains a local `sessionCards` array to protect original deck order unless explicitly modified.
- **Shuffle Feature**: 
    - **Logic**: Implements a randomization algorithm (Shuffle) that resets the `currentIndex` and `results` map.
    - **Visual**: Displays a "Shuffled" badge and triggers a subtle confetti burst to confirm the action.
- **Grading System**:
    - "Got it" (Mastered): Sets the card's mastered status to true.
    - "Still Learning": Sets mastered status to false.
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bar calculated as `(current_card / total_cards) * 100`.
- **Completion**: Aggregates session results and updates the global deck state once the session ends.

### 3.3 Dashboard & Deck Management (`App.tsx`)
- **State Persistence**: Syncs all deck data to `localStorage` on every change.
- **View Routing**: An enum-based routing system (`AppView`) manages transitions between Dashboard, Editor, Study, and Stats views without page reloads.
- **Theming**: Dynamic theme colors (e.g., Indigo, Emerald) assigned to decks for visual categorization.

### 3.4 Data Analytics (`components/DeckStats.tsx` & `GlobalStats.tsx`)
- **Mastery Calculation**: `(mastered_cards / total_cards) * 100`.
- **Visualization**: Circular SVG progress charts with CSS transitions for smooth animation.
- **Focused Review**: Automatically identifies and lists "Focus Areas"—cards that the user hasn't yet mastered.

### 3.5 UI Components
- **CardFlip**: Employs CSS 3D transforms (`rotateY`) and `backface-visibility: hidden` for a realistic card flipping interaction.
- **NavBars**: Sticky headers and mobile-responsive layouts ensure controls are always accessible.

## 4. Technical Stack
- **Framework**: React 19 (ESM via esm.sh).
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (Utility-first styling).
- **Icons**: Lucide React.
- **AI**: Google Gemini API (@google/genai).
- **Effects**: Canvas Confetti.

## 5. Future Roadmap
- Spaced Repetition System (SRS) integration (Leitner system).
- Support for image-based cards using Gemini Multimodal.
- Export/Import decks via JSON or CSV.
- Audio synthesis for language learning decks.
